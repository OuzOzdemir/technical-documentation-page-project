        <p>Accessibility generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, navigated, and
          interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive
          disabilities.</p>
        <p>Websites should be open and accessible to everyone, regardless of a user's abilities or resources. Some users
          rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader or voice recognition software. Other users may be able to
          navigate through a site only using a keyboard. Keeping the needs of various users in mind when developing your
          project can go a long way towards creating an open web.</p>
        <p>Here are three general advices to create a good design:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>have well-organized code that uses appropriate markup
          </li>
          <li>ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content
          </li>
          <li>create an easily-navigated page that's keyboard-friendly

      <header>Adding text alternative to images</header>
      <article>
        <p>Alt text describes the content of the image and provides a text-alternative for it. This helps in cases where
          the image fails to load or can't be seen by a user. It's also used by search engines to understand what an
          image contains to include it in search results. Here's a code example:</p>
        <code>&lt;img src="importantLogo.jpeg" alt="Company logo"&gt;</code>
        <p>People with visual impairments rely on screen readers to convert web content to an audio interface. They
          won't get information if it's only presented visually. For images, screen readers can access the alt attribute
          and read its contents to deliver key information.</p>
        <p>Good alt text provides the reader a brief description of the image. You should always include an alt
          attribute on the image. Per HTML5 specification, this is now considered mandatory.</p>

      <article>
        <p>In situations when an image is already explained with text content, or does not add meaning to a page, the
          img still needs an alt attribute, but it can be set to an empty string. Here's an example:</p>
        <code>&lt;img src="visualDecoration.jpeg" alt=""&gt;</code>
        <p>Background images usually fall under the 'decorative' label as well. However, they are typically applied with
          CSS rules, and therefore not part of the markup screen readers process.</p>
        <p>For images with a caption, you may still want to include alt text, since it helps search engines catalog the
          content of the image.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Using_headings_to_show_hierarchical_relationships_of_content">
      <header>Using headings to show hierarchical relationships of content</header>
      <article>
        <p>Headings (h1 through h6 elements) are workhorse tags that help provide structure and labeling to your
          content. Screen readers can be set to read only the headings on a page so the user gets a summary. This means
          it is important for the heading tags in your markup to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, not be
          picked merely for their size values.</p>
        <p>Semantic meaning means that the tag you use around content indicates the type of information it contains.</p>
        <p>If you were writing a paper with an introduction, a body, and a conclusion, it wouldn't make much sense to
          put the conclusion as a subsection of the body in your outline. It should be its own section. Similarly, the
          heading tags in a webpage need to go in order and indicate the hierarchical relationships of your content.</p>
        <p>Headings with equal (or higher) rank start new implied sections, headings with lower rank start subsections
          of the previous one.</p>
        <p>As an example, a page with an h2 element followed by several subsections labeled with h4 tags would confuse a
          screen reader user. With six choices, it's tempting to use a tag because it looks better in a browser, but you
          can use CSS to edit the relative sizing.</p>
        <p>One final point, each page should always have one (and only one) h1 element, which is the main subject of
          your content. This and the other headings are used in part by search engines to understand the topic of the
          page.</p>

      <article>
        <p>HTML5 introduced a number of new elements that give developers more options while also incorporating
          accessibility features. These tags include main, header, footer, nav, article, and section, among others.</p>
        <p>By default, a browser renders these elements similarly to the humble div. However, using them where
          appropriate gives additional meaning in your markup. The tag name alone can indicate the type of information
          it contains, which adds semantic meaning to that content. Assistive technologies can access this information
          to provide better page summary or navigation options to their users.</p>
        <p>The main element is used to wrap the main content, and there should be only one per page. It's meant to
          surround the information that's related to the central topic of your page. It's not meant to include items
          that repeat across pages, like navigation links or banners.</p>
        <p>The main tag also has an embedded landmark feature that assistive technology can use to quickly navigate to
          the main content. If one've ever seen a "Jump to Main Content" link at the top of a page, using a main tag
          automatically gives assistive devices that functionality.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Wrapping_content_in_the_article_element">
      <header>Wrapping content in the article element</header>
      <article>
        <p>Article is another one of the new HTML5 elements that adds semantic meaning to your markup. Article is a
          sectioning element, and is used to wrap independent, self-contained content. The tag works well with blog
          entries, forum posts, or news articles.</p>
        <p>Determining whether content can stand alone is usually a judgement call, but there are a couple simple tests
          can be used. Ask yourself if you removed all surrounding context, would that content still make sense?
          Similarly for text, would the content hold up if it were in an RSS feed?</p>
        <p>Remember that using assistive technologies rely on organized, semantically meaningful markup to better
          understand your work.</p>
        <p>The section element is also new with HTML5, and has a slightly different semantic meaning than article. An
          article is for standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically related content. They can be
          used within each other, as needed. For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section. When
          there's no relationship between groups of content, then use a div.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;div&gt; - groups content</li>
          <li>&lt;section&gt; - groups related content</li>
          <li>&lt;article&gt; - groups independent, self-contained content</li>

      <header>Making screen reader navigation easier</header>
      <article>
        <p>The next HTML5 element that adds semantic meaning and improves accessibility is the header tag. It's used to
          wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag and works well around content that's
          repeated at the top on multiple pages.</p>
        <p>Header shares the embedded landmark feature you saw with main, allowing assistive technologies to quickly
          navigate to that content.</p>
        <p>The header is meant for use in the body tag of your HTML document. This is different than the head element,
          which contains the page's title, meta information, etc.</p>
        <p>The nav element is another HTML5 item with the embedded landmark feature for easy screen reader navigation.
          This tag is meant to wrap around the main navigation links in your page.</p>
        <p>If there are repeated site links at the bottom of the page, it isn't necessary to markup those with a nav tag
          as well. Using a footer (covered in the next challenge) is sufficient.</p>
        <p>Similar to header and nav, the footer element has a built-in landmark feature that allows assistive devices
          to quickly navigate to it. It's primarily used to contain copyright information or links to related documents
          that usually sit at the bottom of a page.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Improving_accessibility_of_audio_content_with_the_audio_element">
      <header>Improving accessibility of audio content with the audio element</header>
      <article>
        <p>HTML5's audio element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup.
          Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. This
          can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.</p>
        <p>The audio tag supports the controls attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other
          controls, and supports keyboard functionality. This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value,
          its presence on the tag turns the setting on.</p>
        <p>Here's an example:</p>
        <code>&lt;audio id="meowClip" controls&gt; <br>
      &lt;source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"/&gt; <br> 
      &lt;source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg"/&gt; <br>
      &lt;/audio&gt;</code>
        <p>Multimedia content usually has both visual and auditory components. It needs synchronized captions and a
          transcript so users with visual and/or auditory impairments can access it. Generally, a web developer is not
          responsible for creating the captions or transcript, but needs to know to include them.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Improving_chart_accessibility_with_the_figure_element">
      <header>Improving chart accessibility with the figure element</header>
      <article>
        <p>HTML5 introduced the figure element, along with the related figcaption. Used together, these items wrap a
          visual representation (like an image, diagram, or chart) along with its caption. This gives a two-fold
          accessibility boost by both semantically grouping related content, and providing a text alternative that
          explains the figure.</p>
        <p>For data visualizations like charts, the caption can be used to briefly note the trends or conclusions for
          users with visual impairments.</p>
        <p>Here's an example - note that the figcaption goes inside the figure tags and can be combined with other
          elements:</p>
        <code>&lt;figure&gt; <br>
  &lt;img src="roundhouseDestruction.jpeg" alt="Photo of Camper Cat executing a roundhouse kick"&gt; <br>
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Master Camper Cat demonstrates proper form of a roundhouse kick.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</code>

      <header>Improving form field accessibility with the label</header>
      <article>
        <p>Improving accessibility with semantic HTML markup applies to using both appropriate tag names as well as
          attributes.</p>
        <p>The label tag wraps the text for a specific form control item, usually the name or label for a choice. This
          ties meaning to the item and makes the form more readable. The for attribute on a label tag explicitly
          associates that label with the form control and is used by screen readers.</p>
        <p>The value of the for attribute must be the same as the value of the id attribute of the form control. Here's
          an example:</p>
        <code>
        &lt;form&gt; <br>
          &lt;label for="name">Name:&lt;/label&gt; <br>

      <header>Wrapping radio buttons in a fieldset element for better accessibility</header>
      <article>
        <p>Since radio buttons often come in a group where the user must choose one, there's a way to semantically show
          the choices are part of a set.</p>
        <p>The fieldset tag surrounds the entire grouping of radio buttons. It often uses a legend tag to provide a
          description for the grouping, which is read by screen readers for each choice in the fieldset element.</p>
        <p>The fieldset wrapper and legend tag are not necessary when the choices are self-explanatory, like a gender
          selection. Using a label with the for attribute for each radio button is sufficient.</p>
        <p>Here's an example:</p>
        <code>
        &lt;form&gt; <br>
          &lt;fieldset&gt; <br>
           &lt;legend&gt;Choose one of these three items:&lt;/legend&gt;<br>

      <header>Adding an accessible date picker</header>
      <article>
        <p>Forms often include the input field, which can be used to create several different form controls. The type
          attribute on this element indicates what kind of input will be created.</p>
        <p>HTML5 introduced an option to specify a date field. Depending on browser support, a date picker shows up in
          the input field when it's in focus, which makes filling in a form easier for all users.</p>
        <p>For older browsers, the type will default to text, so it helps to show users the expected date format in the
          label or as placeholder text just in case.</p>
        <p>Here's an example:</p>
        <code>
        &lt;label for="input1"&gt;Enter a date:&lt;/label&gt; <br>

      <article>
        <p>Continuing with the date theme, HTML5 also introduced the time element along with a datetime attribute to
          standardize times. This is an inline element that can wrap a date or time on a page. A valid format of that
          date is held by the datetime attribute. This is the value accessed by assistive devices. It helps avoid
          confusion by stating a standardized version of a time, even if it's written in an informal or colloquial
          manner in the text.</p>
        <p>Here's an example:</p>
        <code>
      &lt;p&gt;Master Camper Cat officiated the cage match between Goro and Scorpion&lt;time datetime="2013-02-13"&gt;last Wednesday&lt;/time&gt;, which ended in a draw.&lt;/p&gt;

      <header>Making elements only visible to a screen reader by using custom CSS</header>
      <article>
        <p>CSS's magic can improve accessibility on your page when you want to visually hide content meant only for
          screen readers. This happens when information is in a visual format (like a chart), but screen reader users
          need an alternative presentation (like a table) to access the data. CSS is used to position the screen
          reader-only elements off the visual area of the browser window.</p>
        <p>Here's an example of the CSS rules that accomplish this:</p>
        <code>
        .sr-only { position: absolute; left: -10000px; width: 1px; height: 1px; top: auto; overflow: hidden; }
      </code>
        <p>"display: none;"" or "visibility: hidden;"" hides content for everyone, including screen reader users. Zero
          values for pixel sizes, such as "width: 0px; height: 0px;" removes that element from the flow of your
          document, meaning screen readers will ignore it.</p>

      <article>
        <p>Low contrast between the foreground and background colors can make text difficult to read. Sufficient
          contrast improves the readability of your content, but what exactly does "sufficient" mean?</p>
        <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio for normal text.
          The ratio is calculated by comparing the relative luminance values of two colors. This ranges from 1:1 for the
          same color, or no contrast, to 21:1 for white against black, the strongest contrast. There are many contrast
          checking tools available online that calculate this ratio for you.</p>

        <p>Color is a large part of visual design, but its use introduces two accessibility issues. First, color alone
          should not be used as the only way to convey important information because screen reader users won't see it.
          Second, foreground and background colors need sufficient contrast so colorblind users can distinguish them.
        </p>
        <p>The WCAG-recommended contrast ratio of 4.5:1 applies for color use as well as gray-scale combinations.</p>
        <p>Colorblind users have trouble distinguishing some colors from others - usually in hue but sometimes lightness
          as well. You may recall the contrast ratio is calculated using the relative luminance (or lightness) values of
          the foreground and background colors.</p>
        <p>In practice, the 4.5:1 contrast ratio can be reached by shading (adding black to) the darker color and
          tinting (adding white to) the lighter color. Darker shades on the color wheel are considered to be shades of
          blues, violets, magentas, and reds, whereas lighter tinted colors are oranges, yellows, greens, and
          blue-greens.</p>

        <p>There are various forms of colorblindness. These can range from a reduced sensitivity to a certain wavelength
          of light to the inability to see color at all. The most common form is a reduced sensitivity to detect greens.
        </p>
        <p>For example, if two similar green colors are the foreground and background color of your content, a
          colorblind user may not be able to distinguish them. Close colors can be thought of as neighbors on the color
          wheel, and those combinations should be avoided when conveying important information.</p>
        <p>Some online color picking tools include visual simulations of how colors appear for different types of
          colorblindness. These are great resources in addition to online contrast checking calculators.</p>

      <article>
        <p>Screen reader users have different options for what type of content their device reads. This includes
          skipping to (or over) landmark elements, jumping to the main content, or getting a page summary from the
          headings. Another option is to only hear the links available on a page.</p>
        <p>
          Screen readers do this by reading the link text, or what's between the anchor (a) tags. Having a list of
          "click here" or "read more" links isn't helpful. Instead, you should use brief but descriptive text within the
          a tags to provide more meaning for these users.

        <p>HTML offers the accesskey attribute to specify a shortcut key to activate or bring focus to an element. This
          can make navigation more efficient for keyboard-only users.</p>
        <p>HTML5 allows this attribute to be used on any element, but it's particularly useful when it's used with
          interactive ones. This includes links, buttons, and form controls.</p>
        <p>Here's an example:</p>
        <code>
        &lt;button accesskey="b"&gt;Important Button&lt;/button&gt;
      </code>

      <header>Using tabindex to add keyboard focus to an element</header>
      <article>
        <p>The HTML tabindex attribute has three distinct functions relating to an element's keyboard focus. When it's
          on a tag, it indicates that element can be focused on. The value (an integer that's positive, negative, or
          zero) determines the behavior.</p>
        <p>Certain elements, such as links and form controls, automatically receive keyboard focus when a user tabs
          through a page. It's in the same order as the elements come in the HTML source markup. This same functionality
          can be given to other elements, such as div, span, and p, by placing a " tabindex="0" " attribute on them.
          Here's an example:</p>
        <code>
        &lt;div tabindex="0"&gt;I need keyboard focus!&lt;/div&gt;
      </code>
        <p>A negative tabindex value (typically -1) indicates that an element is focusable, but is not reachable by the
          keyboard. This method is generally used to bring focus to content programmatically (like when a div used for a
          pop-up window is activated).</p>

      <header>Using tabindex to specify the order of keyboard focus for several elements</header>
      <article>
        <p>The tabindex attribute also specifies the exact tab order of elements. This is achieved when the value of the
          attribute is set to a positive number of 1 or higher.</p>
        <p>Setting a "tabindex="1""will bring keyboard focus to that element first. Then it cycles through the sequence
          of specified tabindex values (2, 3, etc.), before moving to default and "tabindex="0"" items.</p>
        <p>It's important to note that when the tab order is set this way, it overrides the default order (which uses
          the HTML source). This may confuse users who are expecting to start navigation from the top of the page. This
          technique may be necessary in some circumstances, but in terms of accessibility, take care before applying it.
        </p>
        <p>Here's an example:</p>
        <code>
        &lt;div tabindex="1">I get keyboard focus, and I get it first!&lt;/div&gt; <br>
        &lt;div&gt; tabindex="2">I get keyboard focus, and I get it second!&lt;/div&gt; <br>
